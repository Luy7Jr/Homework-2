        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Do you need to write an ‘About Me’ page? It’s one of the most important components of your portfolio, website, or blog. It’s where prospective employers, potential clients, website users, and other professional and personal connections go to learn about who you are and what you do. And it's an ideal resource for promoting your professional brand. 
          Writing an ‘About Me’ page or section for yourself is never easy. However, the good news is if you follow the formula and tips below, you should be able to generate an engaging ‘About Me’ statement without too much of a struggle. Here’s how to write an ‘About Me’ page you can be proud of.
          Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed charts. The safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center
          There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).
          space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
